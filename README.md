# README.md for FTPServerOnMac #

### About ###
I was looking for a method to create an FTP server on my Mac to transfer files to my Android device when I came upon a terminal command for it.  
There was absolutely no way I was going to type all that into a terminal window everytime I needed to start/stop the FTP server, so I created these two scripts.

### NOTE: If you intend on accessing your files from an external network, it'd be better to look into SFTP or something else as FTP can make your computer vulnerable. Use at your own risk. I will take no responsibility if using an FTP server causes your computer to crash, get infected with viruses or starts a nuclear war.
